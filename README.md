An unofficial repository for openly-licensed SDK files from Blackmagic's Desktop Video software development kit. These files were from a zip which used to live at a public url at http://software.blackmagicdesign.com/SDK/Blackmagic_DeckLink_SDK_10.1.4.zip

The version 10.1.4 is still available at their [support](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support) page. There are newer versions as well, incuding 10.8.3 which has been published on 2016–11–16.
