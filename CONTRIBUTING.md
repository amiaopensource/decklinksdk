# Contribution Guide

## Rules for contributing code

This repository is intended to share files from [Blackmagic](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/) Decklink SDK. Initially this repository was established with a copy of SDK files from [Blackmagic_DeckLink_SDK_10.1.4.zip](http://software.blackmagicdesign.com/SDK/Blackmagic_DeckLink_SDK_10.1.4.zip) which is presently offline, but was once accessible via a public url without any download agreement. Blackmagic does make newer versions of the SDK available but in addition to the licensing terms of the files in the SDK, which is restated in [license.md], the newer downloads are only accessible if accepting a more restrictive agreement on what the receipient of the SDK may do with those files. Please respect Blackmagic's terms and consider [advocating for an openly-managed SDK](https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=52893&e=0).
